            <p>We use the agile method Scrum in our work.</p>
            <p>Scrum is the most popular Agile framework. It is an adaptive, iterative, fast, fexible, and effective methodology designed to deliver significant value quickly and throughout a project.</p>
            <p>Scrum ensures transparency in communication and creates an environment of collective accountability and continuous progress. A Scrum project involves a collaborative effort to create a new product, service, or other result as defined in the Project Vision Statement. Projects are impacted by constraints of time, cost, scope, quality, resources, organizational capabilities, and other limitations that make them difficult to plan, execute, manage, and ultimately succeed. However, successful implementation of the results of a finished project provides significant business benefits to an organization. It is therefore important for organizations to select and practice an appropriate project management methodology.</p>
            <p>A key strength of Scrum lies in its use of cross-functional, self-organized, and empowered teams who divide their work into short, concentrated work cycles called Sprints. The focus of Scrum on value driven delivery helps Scrum Teams deliver results as early in the project as possible.</p>
