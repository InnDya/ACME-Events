CLASS

1.  Workshop: Introduction to Hacking

November 19, 2020

pic - classIntrToHack.

Take this intro course to learn how hackers use cryptography to protect (and steal) data.

Data is one of the most valuable assets that anyone owns, which is why stealing data is the goal of many cyber attacks. In this beginner-level course, we'll take you into the world of cryptography, showing you how to hide and store data using this powerful tool.
We’ll talk about some of the most common methods used to encrypt data, and show you some of the tactics used by "black hat" hackers to break that encryption. You'll learn a bit of theory, then go "hands on" with real-world encryption tools that cybersecurity practitioners use every day.
This class is taught by Fullstack Cyber Bootcamp's Lead Instructor Corey Greenwald, in a live video classroom (via Zoom) with other students. You'll use some of the same learning tools that we use on campus, so this class will give you a good sense for what it's like to attend Fullstack Cyber Bootcamp.
All that's needed to participate is a computer (Mac or Windows) and a stable internet connection. No experience required!
